 * 
 * This Activity is the activity that sends out an email to a entered email.
 * When this activity is started, it must have an activity that contains the Recipe
 * that the user desires to email. The intent that is passed to SendEmailActivity
 * MUST CONTAINT a recipe that has been turned to a string WITH THE KEY="recipe".
 * If there is no key="recipe", the Activity will send an email with an error message
 * in the text area.
 * 
 * NOTE: THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND AN EMAIL IN THE EMULATOR! IT MUST BE
 * 			RUN ON A REAL ANDROID DEVICE. This is because it uses an external email
 * 			client to send the email.
